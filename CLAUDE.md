# Pure Cleaning CRM — Active Law

> Auto-read at session start. These rules apply to every task, every session.

## How to use this file

**CLAUDE.md is the active law** — rules that apply to every task. Read this first.

For full architectural rationale, code patterns, and schema detail, read **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**.

For project history, timeline, and the architectural decisions log, read **`docs/HISTORY.md`**.

When in doubt, follow this file. The other two are reference.

---

## Active Rules

**1.** Read this file before making any change.

**2.** `npm run deploy` ends with `🟢 Browser verification passed`. Never declare success before seeing that line.

**3.** Three deploys, three failures → STOP. Diagnose the deeper layer. Don't retry.

**4.** Bug feels mysterious → go read-only first. Diagnose full stack (live URL → headers → file → API → render sim) before changing anything.

**5.** Tyler hard-refreshes by default. Visual issues are not browser cache. Don't suggest it.

**6.** Snapshot before any bulk KV write: `POST /import/snapshot`, confirm key in response, then proceed.

**7.** Never PUT /customers with a placeholder payload. PUT replaces the entire database. Use GET to validate, not PUT.

**8.** All KV data reads and writes go through the worker admin API. `wrangler kv` commands are READ-ONLY diagnostics — never write tools. Same namespace ID, different edge state. (Full detail: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → KV Access Policy.)

**9.** Never hardcode secrets in source files or shell commands. Read ADMIN_PASSWORD from `.env.local`. Worker secrets via `wrangler secret put`.

**10.** After any fix matching a Section 9 trigger (deploy mismatch, CSS contrast bug, field naming mismatch, auth/CORS issue, "declared success and Tyler found it broken"): update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `scripts/verify-deploy.js` before closing the session.

**11.** Referral-only customers (`isReferralOnly: true` OR phone starts with `REFERRAL_`) are excluded from ALL outreach — review requests, reactivation, bulk SMS. Add the guard to every new "find eligible customers" function.

**12.** `csv_backfill` jobHistory entries (`source: 'csv_backfill'`) are synthetic historical records with `completedAt: null`. Exclude them from any "most recent entry", "GPS match", or "eligible for outreach" pattern.

**13.** Customer-facing HTML pages (quote form, agreement, receipt, q.html) may only call API routes listed as public in `cloudflare-worker/src/AUTH_BOUNDARIES.md`. Any protected-endpoint call from a customer page = deploy blocker.

**14.** All dates stored and compared as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Accepted input: `5/6/26`, `5/6/2026`, `YYYY-MM-DD`. Any of those parses to canonical form. All other formats rejected — never silently coerced.

**15.** Migration and schema changes: Saturday morning OR weekday after 8 PM ET only. Never Tuesday–Thursday AM — those are Mom's heaviest call hours.

**16.** KV access: all reads/writes via worker admin API endpoints (`GET /customers`, `PUT /customers`, `POST /import/snapshot`). `wrangler kv key get/put` accesses a different edge state and writes silently fail to reach production. (Full story: `docs/HISTORY.md` → May 14.)

**17.** E.164 phone format: D1 `Person.primaryPhone` is always `+1XXXXXXXXXX`. KV stores raw 10-digit phones. Never compare directly. When mapping E.164 back to a KV-format lookup key, strip the leading `1` — `re.sub(r'\D','',e164)[1:]`. (Footgun detail: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → E.164 Phone Format.)

**18.** Number inputs in admin forms must not pre-fill with `0`. Use `placeholder="Enter amount"`. Zero defaults cause silent $0 jobs when a field is skipped.

**19.** D1 is canonical for customer-data reads. `GET /customers` and `GET /customer/:phone` read from D1 via compatibility layer (`d1AllCustomersToKvShape` / `d1CustomerToKvShape`). KV remains write-canonical via dual-write infrastructure. A TEMP KV bridge merges Bouncie GPS fields (`actualDuration`, `bouncieMetrics`, etc.) and geocoded coordinates into D1 read results — remove after D1 schema gains those columns. Day 2 migration completed 2026-05-20.

## Working with Tyler

- **One fix at a time.** Validate before moving to the next.
- **Read-only diagnostic when a bug is mysterious.** Show evidence first, fix second.
- **Snapshot before destructive changes.** No exceptions.
- **Terse responses.** No preamble, no trailing summary that repeats the diff.
- **Hard refresh is muscle memory.** Visual issues are not cache. Don't say cache.
- **When the same pattern fails three times, STOP.** Diagnose the deeper layer.
- **Honest feedback over hype.** If something is wrong, say so directly.
